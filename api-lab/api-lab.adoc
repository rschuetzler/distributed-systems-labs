Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a key part of building many useful applications today.
If an application provides an API, it can allow others to build new things with the functionality provided.
In this assignment, you will investigate web APIs in two different ways: Zapier, and Postman.
After working with these two tools, you will better understand how APIs function, and how you might use them in an application that you build.

To complete this assignment, you will create one (1) document with screenshots showing your results in the two sections. 
You do not need to document your whole process. 
Required screenshots are marked with a computer icon ( icon:desktop[] ).
Required answers to questions are marked with a keyboard ( icon:keyboard-o[] )

== Part 1: Zapier

Zapier (https://zapier.com/) is an automation tool that integrates APIs provided by other applications to create powerful automations (called Zaps).
With a free account, you are able to create automations with two steps: a trigger and an action.
Typically a Zap will use a trigger from one application to do an action in a different application.
Popular app integrations include Gmail, Trello, Dropbox, and a bunch of to do list applications.

Triggers are used to start an automation.
For example, the GitHub integration has triggers for "New Commit," "New Repository," "New Mention," and about a dozen others.
When an event triggers a Zap, specific information from the event can be passed to the corresponding action.

Actions are used to do something once the trigger has started.
For example, GitHub has actions for creating comments, updating issues, or deleting branches.
Gmail has actions for sending email, drafting email, and adding or removing labels from mail.

NOTE: In order for Zapier to work for your sites, you need to authorize it to do things for you. They are a reputable service, but if you do not trust it, you can create a separate account on services you want to integrate just to test things out. For example, you can create a separate GitHub or Gmail account for this assignment to test integrations with Zapier.

=== Discover

. Go to https://zapier.com/apps/integrations/ and investigate some of the popular integrations (zaps) that people have created with Zapier.
. icon:desktop[] On the integrations page, search for an app that you use to see integrations that others have created for that app.

=== Create
I'll walk you through the process of creating a sample Zap. Let's imagine a scenario where we have a company email account for tech support. When customers send an email to the account that we label as a bug, we want to automatically create a new issue in GitHub for the project.

[start=3]
. *Getting things ready*
.. In GitHub, create a new private repository. Initialize the repository with a `.gitignore` file and a README. The contents don't really matter, but you need to have something in the repo for the integration to work.
+

.. In your Gmail account, create a new label (icon:cog[] -> Labels) called "bugs".
.. Send yourself an email with a sample bug report. Mine was "Major issue: When I connect to the application, my phone is erased."
.. Label the email with the new "bugs" label.
. Create an account at Zapier.com
. On the Zapier Homepage (https://zapier.com/app/home/), select GitHub in the first box, and Gmail in the second.
.. Under "When this happens..." select "New Labeled Email" (this is the trigger)
.. Under "then do this!" select "Create issue" (this is the action)
.. Click "Make a Zap!"

. *Creating the Trigger*
.. Back on Zapier, on the page that comes up, connect Zapier to your Gmail account (remember you can create a dummy account for this assignment if you prefer).
.. Your email should show up under the test condition. If it doesn't, try sending yourself a new email and labeling it again. Select the email as a sample to test the Zap.
. *Creating the Action*
.. Select GitHub as the Action app and Create Issue as the action to perform.
.. Connect Zapier to your GitHub account (again, you can create a dummy account just for this assignment if you wish).
.. Select the test repo you created above as the Repo for the action.
.. For the title, you can have a combination of text you type and text from the email that triggers the action. Type "Email issue:" in the Title box, then click the plus icon on the right to add a field from your email. Select the Subject field of your email.
.. In the Body section, add the "Body plain" section of your email.
.. Skip the Assignee, Milestone, and Labels sections of the action (unless you want to play around with them)

. *Test the Zap*
.. Click the button to send the test to GitHub.
.. Open your GitHub repository and verify that the issue was created as you outlined.
.. On Zapier, click Finish and give your Zap a name, then turn it on.
.. Send another email to yourself with a new subject and body. Apply the `bugs` label and verify that a new issue is automatically created.

=== Explore & Reflect
Now that you understand the process of creating an integration, you can find ways to improve your personal or work life.
Advanced Zapier plans cost up to $75/month, suggesting that these integrations can provide significant value for individuals or companies.

. icon:keyboard-o[] Describe three other integrations you would create. For each one, detail the trigger, the action, what data is passed, and what benefit the integration would provide. They could be company-focused, personal life-focused, or a mixture.

== Using Postman

== Extras

There are other services similar to Zapier.
If-this-then-that (https://ifttt.com) is one that is focused more toward personal use as opposed to Zapier's business focus.
In addition to the API integrations, IFTTT includes iOS and Android applications to let you pull in integration with your phone.
